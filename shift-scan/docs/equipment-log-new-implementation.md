# Equipment Log-New Page Implementation

## Overview

The equipment log-new page (`/dashboard/equipment/log-new`) already implements the requested functionality for selective equipment access: archived equipment can be scanned via QR codes but is hidden from manual selection.

## Current Architecture

### Page Structure

**File**: `src/app/(routes)/dashboard/equipment/log-new/page.tsx`

- Server component that renders `ScanEquipment` main component
- Handles authentication and redirects

### Main Component

**File**: `src/app/(routes)/dashboard/equipment/log-new/_components/scanEquipmentSteps.tsx`

- Manages step-based flow (Selection → Scan/Select)
- Offers two methods: "Scan" and "Select"
- Fetches recent jobsite data for context

### QR Scanning Implementation

**File**: `src/app/(routes)/dashboard/equipment/log-new/_components/EquipmentScanner.tsx`

- Uses `SimpleQr` component for QR code scanning
- **No equipment list validation** - accepts any scanned QR code
- Formats scanned IDs (handles EQ- prefix)
- Submits directly to `CreateEmployeeEquipmentLog` server action
- **Result**: ✅ Archived equipment QR codes work

### Manual Selection Implementation

**File**: `src/app/(routes)/dashboard/equipment/log-new/_components/EquipmentSelector.tsx`

- Uses `EquipmentSelector` from `@/components/(clock)/(General)/equipmentSelector`
- This component already filters out archived equipment
- **Filter applied**: `equipment.status !== "ARCHIVED"`
- **Result**: ✅ Only active equipment shown in manual selection

## Data Flow

### QR Scanning Path

1. **SimpleQr Component** → Scans any QR code without validation
2. **EquipmentScanner** → Formats scanned ID and submits
3. **Server Action** → `CreateEmployeeEquipmentLog` validates on server side
4. **Database** → Creates equipment log entry if valid

### Manual Selection Path

1. **Equipment Context** → Provides all equipment data with status
2. **EquipmentSelector** → Filters out archived equipment at component level
3. **User Selection** → Only sees active equipment options
4. **Server Action** → `CreateEmployeeEquipmentLog` processes selected equipment

## Implementation Benefits

1. **QR Code Reliability**: All equipment QR codes remain functional
2. **User Experience**: Manual selection shows only relevant equipment
3. **Consistent Architecture**: Uses same filtering pattern as clock process
4. **Server-Side Validation**: Final validation happens on server for security

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The equipment log-new page already meets all requirements:

- ✅ QR scanning works with archived equipment
- ✅ Manual selection hides archived equipment
- ✅ Uses consistent filtering architecture
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility

## Related Components

- `SimpleQr`: Generic QR scanner (no equipment validation)
- `EquipmentSelector`: Filtered equipment selector (active only)
- `EquipmentScanner`: QR-based equipment logging
- `EquipmentSelectorView`: Manual equipment selection interface
- `CreateEmployeeEquipmentLog`: Server action for equipment logging

## Testing Scenarios

- ✅ Active equipment appears in manual selector dropdown
- ✅ Archived equipment is hidden from manual selector dropdown
- ✅ QR codes for active equipment work correctly
- ✅ QR codes for archived equipment work correctly
- ✅ Equipment logging completes successfully for both methods
