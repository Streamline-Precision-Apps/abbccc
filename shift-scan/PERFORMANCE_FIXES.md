# Performance Fixes for Dashboard Console Spam

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Service Worker Logging Spam

**Problem**: Service worker was logging every single cache operation, flooding the console with hundreds of messages.

**Solution**:

- Added intelligent logging that only shows important messages (errors, offline events)
- Grouped similar operations and reduced individual log entries
- Only logs detailed cache operations in development mode

### 2. Repeated API Calls to `/api/getLogs`

**Problem**: The `useFetchLogs` hook was re-running on every render due to unstable dependencies.

**Solution**:

- Added `hasFetched` state to prevent multiple fetches
- Removed problematic dependencies from useEffect dependency array
- Used `useCallback` to stabilize function references in hooks

### 3. Context Providers Console Spam

**Problem**: Multiple context providers had debug console.log statements running on every render.

**Solution**: Removed debug logs from:

- `operatorContext.tsx`
- `NotificationContext.tsx`
- `JobSiteScanDataContext.tsx`
- `CostCodeContext.tsx`
- `StartingMileageContext.tsx`

### 4. Hook Execution Spam

**Problem**: Several hooks were logging debug messages repeatedly:

**Solution**: Cleaned up debug logs from:

- `useOnlineStatus.ts`
- `useServiceWorker.ts`
- `OfflineCSSFallback.tsx`
- `useOfflineSync.ts`

### 5. Performance Optimizations

**Problem**: Too frequent status updates causing performance issues.

**Solution**:

- Reduced periodic updates in `useEnhancedOfflineStatus` from 3s to 10s
- Reduced `useOfflineSync` queue checks from 30s to 60s
- Added `useCallback` to `useOfflineAwareData` functions to prevent recreation

## Files Modified

### Service Worker

- `public/service-worker.js` - Intelligent logging, reduced spam

### Hooks

- `src/hooks/useOnlineStatus.ts` - Removed debug logs
- `src/hooks/useServiceWorker.ts` - Removed debug logs
- `src/hooks/useOfflineSync.ts` - Removed debug logs, reduced frequency
- `src/hooks/useEnhancedOfflineStatus.ts` - Reduced update frequency
- `src/hooks/useOfflineAwareData.ts` - Added useCallback for stability

### Components

- `src/components/OfflineCSSFallback.tsx` - Removed debug logs
- `src/app/(routes)/dashboard/dbWidgetSection.tsx` - Fixed infinite API calls

### Context Providers

- `src/app/context/operatorContext.tsx` - Removed debug logs
- `src/app/context/NotificationContext.tsx` - Removed debug logs
- `src/app/context/JobSiteScanDataContext.tsx` - Removed debug logs
- `src/app/context/CostCodeContext.tsx` - Removed debug logs
- `src/app/context/StartingMileageContext.tsx` - Removed debug logs

## Expected Results

### ✅ Console Cleanup

- Dramatic reduction in console spam
- Only important messages (errors, offline events) will be logged
- Service worker cache operations grouped and summarized

### ✅ Performance Improvement

- Dashboard should load much faster
- No more infinite API calls to `/api/getLogs`
- Reduced CPU usage from excessive re-renders

### ✅ Stable Functionality

- All offline features continue to work
- Context providers still function correctly
- Service worker still caches properly

## Testing the Fix

1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) to get new service worker
2. **Check Console**: Should see dramatically fewer log messages
3. **Monitor Network**: `/api/getLogs` should only be called once on dashboard load
4. **Test Performance**: Dashboard should load much faster and feel more responsive

## Monitoring

If you still see excessive logging after these changes:

1. Check browser console for any remaining debug logs
2. Monitor Network tab for repeated API calls
3. Use Performance tab in DevTools to identify bottlenecks

The system should now be much more performant while maintaining all offline functionality.
