Last month, I reset my entire computer becuase it was having problems, once I had vs code and next.js downloaded, I was troubleshooting because vs code was acting like next.js wasn't downloaded. It turned out to be an issue caused by one drive.

I reasearched prisma databases and how they work in order to develop the form page for injury reports.

## 7/2/2024

I finished some more prisma DB research and Created the clock out dashboard page and started creation of a the Before you go page.

## 7/3/2024

- I reorganized the Dashboard buttons to match the desired format.
- I took better notes for Prisma DB to prepare for helping Devun debug something.
- Created translated text for clock out buttons.
- I Reformatted the folder structure for clock out and dashboard.
- I simplified and reorganized some components.
