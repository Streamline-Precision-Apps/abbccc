## Prisma research notes.
Here's the complete team workflow for schema changes in a pre-production environment where the database is already running:

For the Team Member Making Changes:
Pull latest changes first:

bash
git pull origin main
npx prisma generate  # Ensure client is up-to-date
Make schema changes in prisma/schema.prisma

Create a migration:

bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name "add_user_profile_table"
This will:

Generate a new migration file

Apply it to your local DB

Update the Prisma Client

Commit and push:

bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add user profile table"
git push origin your-branch
Create a PR for team review

For Other Team Members Receiving Changes:
After PR is merged, pull changes:

bash
git pull origin main
Apply the new migration:

bash
npx prisma migrate dev
This will:

Detect the new migration

Apply it to your local DB

Regenerate the client

Verify the changes:

bash
npx prisma studio
Key Team Practices:
Never modify existing migration files after they're pushed

Always create new migrations for schema changes

Communication:

markdown
#team-db-changes Slack message template:
New migration added: `add_user_profile_table`
- Changes: Added profile table + relation to users
- Run: `npx prisma migrate dev`
- Affected routes: /api/profile/*
Handling Special Cases:
If a migration fails for another team member:

bash
# 1. Reset to clean state (only in pre-prod!)
npx prisma migrate reset

# 2. Reapply all migrations
npx prisma migrate dev
If you get merge conflicts in schema.prisma:

Resolve conflicts carefully

Create a new reconciliation migration:

bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name "merge_conflict_resolution"
