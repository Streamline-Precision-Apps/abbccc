## Prisma research notes.
- npx prisma migrate dev is a command that applies the migrations to the database.
- if you want to make a migration without applying it to the database, you can use npx prisma migrate dev --create-only.
- npx prisma db push is a command that applies the schema changes to the database without creating a migration.
- npx prisma deploy is a command that applies the migrations to the database and updates the schema on the database.
- npx prisma migrate dev --name="migration-name"
- if your migration failed, you need to run npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back "migration-name"  to mark the migration as rolled back.
- Migrations is not something you want to fix things from the past, but is something you want to fix things moving forward.
Pre-Production (During Development)
1. Initial Setup
bash
npm install prisma --save-dev
npx prisma init
2. Define Your Schema
Edit prisma/schema.prisma to define models, relations, enums, etc.

3. Create and Apply Migrations (Frequent during development)
bash
# After each schema change:
npx prisma migrate dev --name "init"  # For first migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name "add_user_model"  # Subsequent migrations
4. Generate Prisma Client
bash
npx prisma generate
# This happens automatically with `prisma migrate dev`
5. Reset Database (When needed)
bash
npx prisma migrate reset
6. Inspect Database
bash
npx prisma studio  # GUI to view data
npx prisma db pull  # Introspect existing DB to create schema (if starting from existing DB)
7. Seed Database (Optional)
bash
npx prisma db seed
# Configure seed script in package.json
Post-Production (After Development Complete)
1. Create Production Migration
bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
2. Generate Production Client
bash
npx prisma generate
3. Database Maintenance Commands
bash
npx prisma migrate diff  # Compare schema changes
npx prisma db push  # Emergency schema updates (use with caution)
4. Production Environment Variables
Ensure DATABASE_URL in production environment points to production DB

Workflow Differences: Development vs Production
Development Phase:
Frequent schema changes

Use prisma migrate dev for all migrations

Database resets are common

May use db push for quick prototyping (not recommended for team projects)

Seed data often refreshed

Production Phase:
Schema changes require careful planning

Use prisma migrate deploy to apply migrations

Never use reset or db push in production

Migration rollbacks require new migration files

Data preservation is critical

Team Collaboration Best Practices
Schema Changes:

Always create a new migration file for each change

Never edit migration files directly after they've been run by teammates

Use descriptive migration names

Version Control:

Commit both schema.prisma and migration files

Do not commit the migrations folder's _journal table

Code Reviews:

Review schema changes carefully

Verify migration SQL before applying to production

Environment Management:

Maintain separate databases for dev, staging, and production

Use different .env files for each environment

Emergency Production Scenario
If you need to modify production schema urgently:

bash
# 1. Create a new migration from your local changes
npx prisma migrate dev --name "emergency_fix"

# 2. Review the generated SQL carefully

# 3. Apply to production
npx prisma migrate deploy

# 4. Generate updated client
npx prisma generate

# 5. Redeploy application
Remember that in production, all schema changes should go through proper testing in staging environments first whenever possible.

## Other work for the day.
