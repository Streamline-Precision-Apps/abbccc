- Great! We've completed the refactoring of all the CostCode components according to the coding standards document. Here's a summary of what we've accomplished:

Updated all components to use proper TypeScript typing:

Created and utilized interfaces from types.ts
Added proper JSDoc comments to improve code documentation
Eliminated any usages of "any" types
Added memoization to improve performance:

Wrapped all components with React.memo
Added useCallback for event handlers
Used useMemo for derived values and formatting operations
Enhanced code organization:

Created utility functions in formatters.ts for code reuse
Improved the barrel file with better organization and comments
Added comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for better type safety
Improved the custom hook:

Enhanced useCostCodeForm with better typing
Added memoization to its callback functions
Improved error handling and state management
Applied best practices:

Added descriptive JSDoc comments to functions over 10 lines
Extracted complex formatting logic to shared utilities
Ensured consistent naming conventions
The refactoring maintains the same UI and functionality while significantly improving code quality, maintainability, and performance. The components now follow the project's coding standards document and incorporate React best practices such as proper memoization and type safety.
