Coding standards, domain knowledge, and preferences that AI should follow.

# General Coding Principles

- Write clean, maintainable, and efficient code.
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
- Prioritize readability, scalability, and maintainability.
- Enforce strict TypeScript settings (strict, noImplicitAny, strictNullChecks, etc.).
- Follow SOLID principles and functional programming patterns where appropriate.
- Avoid over-engineering; solve with the simplest viable architecture.
- Use camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components/types, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants.
- All files must have a single export (default or named) unless it's a utility file.
- Limit function files to <100 LOC where possible.
- Prefer immutability—use spread operators or utility libraries like immer.
- One file per component/service/hook.
- Group code by feature, not by type (domain-driven folder structure).
- Avoid deeply nested folder structures (>3 levels).
- Use barrel files (index.ts) for module exports.
  🧠 Architectural Guidelines
- Use dependency injection for services (where supported, like in NestJS).
- Business logic lives outside of controllers/components.
- Keep side-effects isolated and testable (e.g., in services or utils).
- API consumers must handle all response statuses and errors explicitly.
  🛠️ Performance & Optimization
- Lazy-load components with React.lazy() or Next.js dynamic imports.
- Avoid anonymous functions in JSX when not memoized.
- Memoize expensive computations using useMemo, useCallback.
  💬 Documentation & Comments
- Functions >10 LOC should have JSDoc comments.
- Types/interfaces should include a purpose description.

# Coding Standards

- Use TypeScript for all code, with strict type checking.
- Use ES6+ syntax and features.
- Use camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for types, interfaces, and components.
- Use single quotes for strings.
- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Always use semicolons.
- Prefer arrow functions for anonymous functions and React components.
- Use async/await for asynchronous code; avoid callbacks.
- Use try/catch for error handling in async code.
- Use JSDoc for function and class documentation.
- Use eslint and prettier for linting and formatting.
- Use tsconfig.json for TypeScript configuration.
- Use package.json and npm for dependency management and scripts.
- Write modular, reusable, and testable code.
- Use environment variables for secrets and configuration.
