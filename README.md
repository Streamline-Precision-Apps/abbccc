Today is a new day and i discovered an easy to use qrcode walkthrough, it it linked [Here](https://medium.com/readytowork-org/implementing-a-qr-code-scanner-in-react-4c8f4e3c6f2e)

- all the new code written today was from there and now, i am moving towards altering the sample to make it better. 
you need to just use one extension
- npm i qr-scanner
