# Streamline-Precision-Timecard

This is the readme for the streamline precision timecard app

# Installation instructions
We will be using react.js with next.js for our stack and will have a mySQL database to store data. 

To begin our project we need to install nextjs app and install other dependdecies to run it on our computer. 

The installations are the follow:
- npm install qrcode.react dayjs (qrcode library and dayjs is a lightweight library for handling time)
- additional the library is needed but needs to be installed through legacy due to it being used in older react code:  
npm i react-qr-reader --legacy-peer-deps

An alternative to check out is here we can compare and see what is better. 

- an alternative to the rcode scanning: npm i react-zxing check the library https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-zxing
